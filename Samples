ton Post released the best-known case of AIDS caused by an HIV infection to date
: that of the US ambassador to Canada, Justin Trudeau, who died on May 8. Trudea
u had come as the world's most powerful man in the world, and he is known in Can
ada for his support of progressive policies.

It's not the first time Trudeau has appeared on Canadian television. The ambassa
dor's death came just weeks after Trudeau's brother, Philippe, urged Canada to b
an homosexual marriage, which was condemned by conservative Canadian political l
eaders. His death sent shockwaves throughout social media and the world, but it
never quite stopped critics.

In response to Trudeau's death, Conservative leader Mike Savage released a state
ment that included the word "death." Conservative MP John Baird expressed shock,
 saying, "We have to be careful about when we talk about a death in history, and
 even for the Liberal party, that is a death in the family." It was the last gas
p of a dying Liberal party leader.

Cabinet spokesman Ian Macfarlane tweeted: "Canada will continue to work and coop

on into the death of Justin Trudeau, and will continue to speak out against the
current, harmful approach of promoting homosexuality in Canada."

Conservative MP John Baird tweeted: "We are also sorry for Justin's family. Cana
da is deeply saddened by the loss of our ambassador." He added that Trudeau "has
 continued in his advocacy of the world's most progressive values to support sam
e-sex marriage and to ensure that all Canadians live to be 100% full equal."
